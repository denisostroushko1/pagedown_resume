### University of Minnesota  
<!--bullet point  is above --> 
**MS Biostatistics** 3.845 GPA  <!-- first entry, major and degree in bold. THIS IS A Subtitle--> 

Minneapolis, MN <!-- second position is always a location --> 
 
Expected  2024 - 2022  <!-- dates have to be listed as Newer - Older in the pagedown format --> 

<!-- This is the body of a bullet point pretty much --> 
<!-- we can leave this open --> 
### University of Minnesota - Morris 

**BA Mathematics, Statistics** 3.43 GPA

Morris, MN 

2019 - 2015 



Professional Experience {data-icon=suitcase} 
------------------------------------

### Healthcare Analyst I & II 

**Medica**

Minneapolis, MN 

August 2023 - June 2019 <!-- Date new to date old --> 

- Collaborated with business owners to assess member assistance programs. Used statistical models and simulations to understand cost savings distribution. Developed a strategy, resulting in an additional $1,000,000 annualized savings. 
- Collaborated with member identification team to improve risk models for hospital readmission. Developed a set of predictive models. Best classifier improved AUC score by 15%. 
- Automated actuarial completion factors model using SAS. Improved estimation granularity, reduced prediction error by 35%. Reduced delivery time for the final product. 
- Led the introduction of benchmarks from Milliman proprietary software. Improved identification of cost savings opportunities and increased strategy transparency.
<!-- 
- Inherited a sub optimal data pulling pipeline. Introduced more efficient SAS code for data collection. Developed a set of QA checks against historical data. Reduced run time by 8 hours (55% reduction).

Research Experience {data-icon=book} 
------------------------------------

### Graduate Research Assistant

Master's Thesis

Minneapolis, MN 

Present - August 2023 

- Worked with [Dr. Julian Wolfson](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/julianw) to evaluate the impact of cohort definition on 
the analysis results. 
- Used data from the Fairview Health System to conduct the study. Created a list of cohorts with varying patient inclusion criteria. Illustrated that cohort definition can result in vastly different analysis results and conclusions. 

### Graduate Research Assistant

Multiview Data Integrative Analysis of Progression to AD

Minneapolis, MN 

Present - August 2023 

- Developed a pipeline to identify important predictors of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from lipidomics ADNI data. Generalized pipeline to other genomics data sets.  
- Developed and compared multiview data integration methods (SIDA, iDeepViewLearn) to improve detection of at-risk of AD patients among ANDI cohort population. 

### Research Assistant

[Truckers & Turnover Research Project](https://morris.umn.edu/academics/truckers-turnover-research-project)

Morris, MN 

2019 - 2018

- Managed scripts to produce publication materials. Presented results of medical cost analysis for truck drivers with OSA as a poster. Helped develop a bootstrap simulation to estimate variance of cost differences.
