Education {data-icon=graduation-cap}
------------------------------------

### University of Minnesota  
<!--bullet point  is above --> 
**MS Biostatistics** 3.815 GPA  <!-- first entry, major and degree in bold. THIS IS A Subtitle--> 

Minneapolis, MN <!-- second position is always a location --> 
 
Expected  2024 - 2022  <!-- dates have to be listed as Newer - Older in the pagedown format --> 

<!-- This is the body of a bullet point pretty much --> 
<!-- we can leave this open --> 
### University of Minnesota - Morris 

**BA Mathematics, Statistics** 3.43 GPA

Morris, MN 

2019 - 2015 



Selected Experience {data-icon=suitcase} 
------------------------------------

### Healthcare Analyst II 

**Medica**

Minneapolis, MN 

Present - 2021 <!-- Date new to date old --> 

<!-- now use a list of bullet points to decribe achievements --> 
- Collaborated with business owners to evaluate and improve programs assisting members. Used statistical
models and simulations to understand variance of cost savings estimates. Collaboratively developed a strategy 
to generate additional $1,000,000 annualized savings. 
- Translated actuarial completion factors from spreadsheets to SAS code for automation purposes. Reduced delivery time 
of monthly completion factors from a few days to a few hours. Implemented a more granular way to estimate these factors, 
resulting in 35% prediction error reduction. 
- Collaborated with member identification team to develop a predictive model for members at risk of a 30-day hospital 
readmission. Collectively improved AUC score from 0.72 to 0.79. 

### Healthcare Analyst I 

**Medica** 

Minneapolis, MN 

2021 - 2019 

- Refactored legacy SAS and SQL pipeline for monthly large data set processing. Reduced total tun time by 60%. Introduced  QA checks. <!-- make sure there is no empty line between bullet points so that they render properly in the document --> 
- Produced static and interactive dashboards to visualize and summarize healthcare cost and utilization data for physician services and nursing teams. Automated reports saved 10 hours of manual editing each month.
- Lead the effort to introduce metrics from Milliman proprietary software. New metrics were used for cost savings opportunity identification and lead to more active business units engagement. 

### Research Assistant
<!-- make a hyperlink for the truckers and turnover research project --> 
[Truckers & Turnover Research Project](https://morris.umn.edu/academics/truckers-turnover-research-project)

Morris, MN 

2019 - 2018

- Managed scripts to produce publication materials. Presented results of medical cost analysis for truck drivers with OSA as a poster. Helped develop a bootstrap simulation to estimate variance of cost difference.
